				<p>2020 has been a year of extraordinary hardship. As the world recovers from the first wave of coronavirus, economic decline and record unemployment disrupt the distribution of vital resources like food and healthcare. Low-income communities living in densely populated neighborhoods like Harlem are especially vulnerable to the fallout of the pandemic.</p> 

				<p>In response, communities all over NY are banding together to support one another through mutual aid – a practice of solidarity that seeks to solve issues like hunger through community engagement and social equity. Most mutual aid groups are not organized in traditional hierarchical structures and instead unite neighbors through a common sense of need and organization. Some mutual aid groups go as far as to label themselves anarchists to stress the importance of recognizing members as equals despite age, gender, race, background, ethnicity. Since the pandemic, some of the most popular forms of mutual aid involve public refrigerators and street cleanings operated by neighbors and open to anybody in need. Recently, Hamilton Heights got its own public fridges and local street cleanings to help the community recover.</p>
